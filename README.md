## Key solutions

### FaceExpression

We recognizes 7 face expressions consisting of neutral, happiness, sadness, surprise, anger, disgust and fear based on 6 basic emotions. To recognize face expresisons, the facial action units are divided based on Facial Action Coding  System determined by Paul Ekman. For further detail on FaceExpression solution, refer to [FaceExpression repo](https://github.com/emotionist/emotionist-sdk-android/tree/master/faceexpression).

### FaceRppg
 
 We measures heart response non-contactly using a camera. The facial blood volume pulse is estimated from facial color variations and head movements caused by heartbeat using remote Photoplethysmography and Ballistocardiography. Our solution provide heart rate, heart rate variaility reflecting autonomic nervous system activity and respiration. For further detail on FaceRppg solution, refer to [FaceRppg repo](https://github.com/emotionist/emotionist-sdk-android/tree/master/facerppg).
